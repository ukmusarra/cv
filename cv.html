KEY PROJECT EXPERIENCE Previous
Napoli-Bari High Speed Railway Line - Italy 
Apice-Hirpinia section is part of new infrastructure with a total extension of approximately 18.7 kilometers. The final project aims to double railway route with new double-track railway line between Apice and Hirpinia; new Apice stop; new station of ’Hirpinia’, in the municipal territory of Ariano Irpino. I've performed numerical analysis work for value engineering and tender to design for High Speed Railway TAV (Treno Alta Velocità) project, including conventional and mechanized tunneling methods

New International Airport of Mexico City (NAICM) - USD 13B - Mexico 
Designer’s Site Representative for the New International Airport of Mexico City, to be the busiest airport in Latin America. Extremely challenging project with more than 50m thick soft clay to be consolidated, subsidence problems, interbedded with compact sand layers. Methods included surcharge, vacuum, geodrain, jet grouting and so forth. Led the team on Runway 6, technical support on Runways 2 & 3, commercial aprons and platform. Supported on consolidation design using Observational Method and real-time instrumentation. The project was canceled in Jan 2019 by the new Mexico’s President

Frederikssund Fjord Link Frederikssund - USD 200M – Denmark
Client’s Lead Advisor
Danish Road Directorate
2017
1.4km High Bridge substructure over the Roskilde Fjord and other 16 minor structures, comprising 6.8km of a new 4-lane expressway. Lead Technical Advisor on construction and geotechnical support for rock socket onshore and offshore bored piles with permanent and temporary steel casing, reaching max 2m diam. and 55m depth, also for shallow foundations, pre-cast shells for pier cofferdam, temporary and permanent sheet piles, embankments, pile testing and silent sheet pile wall

East Branch Dam - USD 280M - Pennsylvania, USA
Senior Geotechnical Engineer
United States Army Corps of Engineers
2015
Key member of R&D. Scope included new deep rock socket cutoff wall with Hydromill, permeation grouting, foundation grouting, real-time instrumentation and data acquisition (Ultimate Grouting Control), georadar, ground investigation and database in gINT, live enterprise database integrated with SQL and ArcGIS. Additional work to integrate technical scope and specifications requirements with in-house built Data Management System, the first which has been ever done in USA with 3D real-time construction data for dams. Participated actively in the technical submittals and construction technical support. This was the first dam in USA receiving and managing live data from construction operations and dam monitoring systems

Third Street Light Rail Project Phase 2 - USD 1.6B - San Francisco, USA
Site Engineer
San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency
2014
Key member for rock socket diaphram walls on Chinatown and Moscone metro stations. Management of technical operations on site, liaising with design teams to resolve site-related technical queries. Construction Management of the works related to geotechnical engineering, including managing the construction teams, monitoring progress, budget control, maintaining detailed daily records of site activities. Responsible for construction-related changes, including NCRs, Field Changes and Claims, providing detailed site and technical information to substantiate the changes. Attend and chairing weekly site meetings with the Client to provide update on progress and raise any potential forthcoming issue. Collaborate with the Client to resolve issues arising from the construction works

Salesforce Tower - USD 1.1B - San Francisco, USA
Site Engineer
Salesforce
2014
Saleforce Tower is a 61-story, 1070’ high rise office located in downtown San Francisco. It is the tallest building west of Chicago. Key member onsite. Scope included 42 Reinforced Concrete Load Bearing Elements (each 10’- 6” Long x 60” wide and approximately 270’ deep) by means of Slurry Wall for the building’s foundation system. Equipment on site included a hydromill and hydraulic clamshell which were used to excavate through fill, sand and silt, and clay formations. The LBEs were reinforced with 100,000-pound, 255-foot-long steel cages. Worked around the clock to meet the aggressive schedule.
